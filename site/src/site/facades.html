  <h3>Overview</h3>The <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%E7ade_pattern">Facade
  pattern</a> is what you should have in mind as you design an
  interface for publishing over JRemoting. &nbsp;It goes
  hand-in-hand with <a href=
  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">Immutable
  objects</a>. Understanding both is key to making JRemoting work
  for you.<br />
  <br />
  Facades have methods that are going to be invoked over the wire.
  &nbsp;The results of those methods can either be immutable (also
  known as value objects), or other (secondary) facades. &nbsp;If
  the method returns a secondary facade, it could be the interface
  declared on the return type or a more derived interface. &nbsp;If
  an immutable it can be anything that is serializable, but cannot
  have a reference to anything that's a facade.<br />

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Sample Facades and Immutables
  (Value Objects)</p>

  <div class="source">
    <pre>
interface Bank {<br />
    Account findAccount(int accountID)<br />
}<br />
<br />
interface Account {<br />
    Debit debitFunds(Amount amount, Account toAccount) throws UnsufficientFundsException<br />
    Credit creditFunds(Amount amount, Account fromAccount)<br />
}<br />
<br />
interface SavingsAccount {<br />
    Rate getInterestRate()<br />
}<br />
<br />
interface CheckingAccount {<br />
    Amount getOverdraftLimit()<br />
    void setupAutoTransfer(Amount maxBalance, Account destinationForSurplass)<br />
}<br />
<br />
<br />
class Txn implements Serializable {<br />
    private Amount amount;<br />
    private Date date;<br />
    private String ref;<br />
    public Amount getAmount() { .... }<br />
    public Date getDate() { .... }<br />
    public String getReference() { .... }<br />
}<br />
<br />
class Debit extends Txn {<br />
    private int toAccountID;<br />
    public int getToAccount() { .... }<br />
}<br />
<br />
class Credit extends Txn {<br />
    private int fromAccountID;<br />
    public int getFromAccount() { .... }<br />
}<br />
<br />
class Amount implements Serializable {<br />
    private BigDecimal value;<br />
    public BigDecimal  getValue() { .... }<br />
}<br />
<br />
</pre>
  </div>The interface Bank above is the one that is the primary
  facade. &nbsp;SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount are the
  secondary facade. &nbsp;They are used as return types and
  parameters to methods on the primary facade and each other.<br />
  <br />
  The plain classes Txn, Debit, Credit and Amount are plain classes
  that are serializable. Date and BigDecimal are from Java's
  libraries and are Serializable out of the box.<br />
  <br />
  Note that Credit and Debit have a corresponding account ID rather
  than a reference to the Account itself.<br />
  <br />

  <h3>Note also that the debitFunds method on the primary facade
  has an exception. &nbsp;That exception is plain (it does not
  extend anything special from the JRemoting API) and is replicated
  on the client side by JRemoting. &nbsp;The same would be true of
  exceptions that are drived from RuntimeException.</h3><br />
