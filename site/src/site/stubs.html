  <title>Stubs</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h2>Overview</h2>By default JRemoting will deliver client server
  capabilty without the need for the user to make stubs classes
  (like RMI does with the rmic operation). &nbsp;Reflections's
  dynamic proxy capability is used to deliver that.
  
  There are problems with this approach. &nbsp;Foremost is that it
  will not work in a client that is an applet that is trying to
  exist inside the 'sandbox' without extra permissions. There's
  also a &nbsp;speed issue, but its barely significant.

  <h2>BCEL Stubs</h2>
  BCEL is an Apache technology that can make
  Java class files at runtime. &nbsp;We optionally use that to make Stub
  classes.

  <h3>BcelStubGenerator</h3>Use like RMI's rmic. &nbsp;It can make
  stubs in advance of need. &nbsp;This will allow you to include
  the stub in the jar file your making for your client, or to put
  in a more general stubs jar that you will keep on the&nbsp;client
  side.
  
  Use in Maven2 like so -

  <div class="source">
    <pre>
&lt;build&gt;
  &lt;plugins&gt;
    &lt;plugin&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;org.codehaus.jremoting&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;jremoting-tools&lt;/artifactId&gt;
      &lt;executions&gt;
        &lt;execution&gt;
          &lt;id&gt;SomeName&lt;/id&gt;
          &lt;phase&gt;test-compile&lt;/phase&gt;
          &lt;goals&gt;
            &lt;goal&gt;generate&lt;/goal&gt;
          &lt;/goals&gt;
          &lt;configuration&gt;
            &lt;genName&gt;SomeName&lt;/genName&gt;
            &lt;facade&gt;com.foo.YourFacade&lt;/facade&gt;
            &lt;classGenDir&gt;target/stub-classes&lt;/classGenDir&gt;
            &lt;secondaryFacades&gt;com.foo.AnotherFacade,com.foo.YetAnotherFacade&lt;/secondaryFacades&gt;
            &lt;verbose&gt;true&lt;/verbose&gt;
          &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/execution&gt;
      &lt;/executions&gt;
    &lt;/plugin&gt;
  &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;
</pre>
  </div>

<h2>Client usage</h2>

  <h3>StubsOnClient</h3>
  JRemoting will look in the client's
  classpath for the Stub class.  You will have generated the Stub class in question and bundled in the application jar destined for the client.

  This is good for applets, which by default cannot dynamically mount classes or classloaders.
  <h3>StubsFromServer</h3>
  <p>JRemoting will ask the server for the
  Stub class (and mount it in a classloader meaning it will also
  have the applet problems above).
  
  For this mode, the server can either retrieve the Stubs from the
  server's classpath (<strong>FromClassLoaderStubRetriever</strong>), or from a
  separate jar (<strong>JarFileStubRetriever</strong>), or make them dynamically
  with <strong>BcelDynamicStubRetriever</strong>.  </p>
  <p>In the constructor for the SocketServer (or PipedServer, or RmiServer) the <strong>StubRetriever</strong> instance is passed in.</p>
<h3>StubsViaReflection</h3>
  Stubs are made dynamically via Java's
  reflection. &nbsp;These will not be safe for applet clients that are
  in the sandbox, and are slightly slower than generated stubs.
