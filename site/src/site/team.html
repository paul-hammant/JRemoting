  <h3>Paul Hammant</h3>

  <p>Paul works for ThoughtWorks in the USA. He started JRemoting
  at Apache in 2002 with Vinny as 'AltRMI'. &nbsp;When the project
  started there were not many similar frameworks, now there are
  lots, but its nice to finished something you start :-)</p>

  <p>Paul's <a href="http://paulhammant.com/">blog</a> has a few
  JRemoting related entries</p>

  <h3>Vinay Chandrasekharan</h3>

  <p>Vinay provided much of the early work on JRemoting,
  particularly the BCEL stub generator and a (presently deleted)
  duplex/callback capability. &nbsp;Vinay is not active presently
  on JRemoting, but he's welcome back at any time.</p>

  <h3>Peter Royal</h3>Peter has contributed many parts of
  JRemoting, including concurrency, and paired with Paul on
  numerous occasions.<br />

  codebase.
