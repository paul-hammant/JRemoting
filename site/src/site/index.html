<body>
  <p>It is a transparent RPC (remoting) technology for Java.
  &nbsp;You can publish an object to one or more remote clients via
  one of the interfaces it implements. &nbsp;It is best to honor
  the Facade Pattern while architecting the interface(s) as an RPC
  call over TCP/IP is not cheap.</p>

  <p>JRemoting is Apache 2.0 licensed open source. It is inspired by .Net Remoting and before that the no-longer available Mind Electric Glue technology. JRemoting has been in development since 2002 and for no good reason was not released as 1.0 until 2008.</p>

  <p>Here is an example of a simple facade-style interface and a
  POJO implementation of it:</p>

  <div class="source">
    <pre>
    public interface Bank {
        void credit(BigDecimal amount);
        void debit(BigDecimal amount);
    }

    public Bank implements BankImpl {
        // fields
        public void credit(BigDecimal amount) {
            // etc
        }
        public void debit(BigDecimal amount) {
            // etc
        }
        // other methods
    }
    
</pre>
  </div>

  <h3>Server side publishing</h3>

  <div class="source">
    <pre>
    Bank myBank = new BankImpl();
    server = new SocketServer(new ConsoleServerMonitor(), new InetSocketAddress(10333));
    server.publish(myBank, "BankService", Bank.class);
    server.start();
  
</pre>
  </div>

  <h3>Client side usage</h3>

  <div class="source">
    <pre>
    serviceResolver = new ServiceResolver(new SocketTransport(new ConsoleClientMonitor(), new SocketDetails("localhost", 10333)));<br />
    Bank remoteBank = serviceResolver.resolveService("BankService");
    
</pre>
  </div>

  <h3>Pluggability</h3>

  <p>JRemoting is designed to have pluggable implementations of its
  component parts. Explore the left navigation to see what is
  pluggable.</p>
