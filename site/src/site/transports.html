  <title>Transports</title>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>JRemoting has a number of 'transports' to
  connect clients to servers. Some of the work over the internet,
  some are for more local situations.

  </p>
  <h3>Socket Transport</h3>
  <p>This will work over the internet or an
    intranet, between two different machines. &nbsp;It will also work
  between two different processes on the same machine.<br />
</p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Server side usage</span> </p>
<div class="source">
    <pre>
server = new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SocketServer</span>(new ConsoleServerMonitor(), 
                          new InetSocketAddress(portNum));
</pre>
</div>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Client side usage</p>

  <div class="source">
    <pre>
serviceResolver = new ServiceResolver(new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SocketTransport</span>(new ConsoleClientMonitor(), 
                                                          new SocketDetails("somehost.com", portNum)));
</pre>
  </div>

  <h3>Secure Socket Transport</h3>
  <p>As above, but using SSL.
    &nbsp;You need to set the keyStore and/or trustStore for the VM
    in question.<br />
    <br />
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Server side usage</span>
    
  </p>
  <div class="source">
    <pre>
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/keyStore -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=/path/to/trustStore -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=yourPassword

server = new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SSLSocketServer</span>(new ConsoleServerMonitor(), new InetSocketAddress(portNum));
</pre>
  </div>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Client side usage</p>

  <div class="source">
    <pre>
serviceResolver = new ServiceResolver(new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SSLSocketTransport</span>(new ConsoleClientMonitor(), 
                                                             new SocketDetails("somehost.com", portNum)));
</pre>
  </div>

  <h3>Piped Transport</h3>
  <p>Using Java's built-in pipes, this
  transport will join two parts of the same application with RPC.
  &nbsp;Interestingly you could have a large hierarchy of
  clasloaders with the objects to be serialized duplicated in the
  tree (once for client side, once for server side) and it would
  work. Perhaps even if they were different versions of the same
  jar. &nbsp;Pipes offers some natural threading to the two sides
  of the application.<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Usage</span>

  </p>
  <div class="source">
    <pre>
PipedServer server = new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">PipedServer</span>(new ConsoleServerMonitor(), new InetSocketAddress(portNum));

PipedInputStream in = new PipedInputStream();
PipedOutputStream out = new PipedOutputStream();
server.makeNewConnection(in, out);

serviceResolver = new ServiceResolver(new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">PipedTransport</span>(new ConsoleClientMonitor(), in, out));
</pre>
  </div>

  <h3>Direct Transport</h3>
  <p>Directly wiring a JRemoting server to a
  client mostly serves as a quality/development consideration for
  us. &nbsp;The transport is very fast as no serialization is
  taking place. &nbsp;If you can find a use for it, you will note
  that you can't have a complex classloader design for this.<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Usage</span>

  </p>
  <div class="source">
    <pre>
server = new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">DirectServer</span>((ServerMonitor) mockServerMonitor.proxy());<br />
serviceResolver = new ServiceResolver(new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">DirectTransport</span>(new ConsoleClientMonitor(), server));
</pre>
  </div>

  <h3>Direct Transport - marshaled</h3>
  <p>As above, but with a
    deliberate serialize/deserialize step. &nbsp;Again of marginal
    use for the end user compared to sockets/pipes. This one could
    leverage a hierarchy of classloaders. Specifically, the things
    that would be serialized and/or the facade in question could be
    duplicated within the app, as long as they are are not in the
    same branch of a classloader tree.<br />
    <br />
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Usage</span>
    
  </p>
  <div class="source">
    <pre>
server = new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">DirectMarshalledServer</span>((ServerMonitor) mockServerMonitor.proxy());
serviceResolver = new ServiceResolver(new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">DirectMarshalledTransport</span>(new ConsoleClientMonitor(), server));
</pre>
  </div>

  <h3>Over RMI</h3>
  <p>This is just like the Socket based transports, except that it leverages classic RMI for the transport.<br />
    <br />
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Server side usage</span>

  </p>
  <div class="source">
    <pre>
server = new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">RmiServer</span>(new ConsoleServerMonitor(), 
                          new InetSocketAddress(portNum));
</pre>
  </div>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Client side usage</p>
  <div class="source">
    <pre>
serviceResolver = new ServiceResolver(new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">RmiTransport</span>(new ConsoleClientMonitor(), 
                                                          new SocketDetails("somehost.com", portNum)));
</pre>
  </div>

  <h3>Using Apache Mina for NIO on the server side</h3>
  <p>This is just like the Socket based transports, except that it on the server 
  side <a href="http://mina.apache.org/">Apache Mina</a> is used to leverage NIO. 
  This does not have as fast throughput as plain sockets, it is just able to scale to more concurrent connections<br />
  <br />
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Server side usage</span>

  </p>
  <div class="source">
    <pre>
server = new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">MinaServer</span>(new ConsoleServerMonitor(), 
                          new InetSocketAddress(portNum));
</pre>
  </div>

  <p style="font-weight: bold;">Client side usage</p>
  <div class="source">
    <pre>
serviceResolver = new ServiceResolver(new <span style=
"font-weight: bold;">SocketTransport</span>(new ConsoleClientMonitor(), 
                                                          new SocketDetails("somehost.com", portNum)));
</pre>
  </div>
