  <title>RMI</title>
</head>

<body>
  <p>It is our view that RMI sucks. Admittedly it sucks less in
  2008 than it did ten years ago, but it is still preoccupied on
  forcing end users to be aware of the <a href=
  "http://blogs.sun.com/jag/resource/Fallacies.html">eight
  fallacies of distributed computing</a>, for every invocation.
  From the outset, these are what were annoying about RMI :</p>

  <ul>
    <li><s>RMI forces you to extend 'UnicastRemoteObject'</s>
    -fixed in latter JDKs</li>

    <li>RMI forces you to catch a checked exception -
    'RemoteException' - wherever methods are called.</li>

    <li>RMI forces interfaces to implement 'Remote'</li>

    <li><s>Cumbersome RMI stub compiler</s> - fixed in latter
    JDKs</li>

    <li>Static, though optional, RMI registry</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A developer coding for a remote divide should do so in a way
  that respects the <a href="facades.html">Facade Pattern</a> but
  should be able to leave outage concerns to more centralized
  places.</p>

  <p>Centralized places could be, a handler servlet (through which
  all requests go), or a container such as Spring, PicoContainer or
  Guice (we all adhere to Inversion of Control these days
  right?).</p>
